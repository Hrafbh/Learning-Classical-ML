# Learning Classical Machine Learning

This repository is a personal learning space for classical (non-deep) machine learning. It contains goals, a short list of core algorithms to study, and a simple project example you can implement to practice.

## Goals
- Learn foundational ML concepts (features, labels, train/test, evaluation).
- Implement and compare classical algorithms on small datasets.
- Build reproducible, well-documented experiments.

## Classical Algorithms to Learn
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- k-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Simple Project Example — Iris Classification

Goal: Predict the species of Iris flowers from sepal/petal measurements.

Dataset: Use the Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`
